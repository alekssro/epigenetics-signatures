Although originally based on first principles, this claim is now empirically well supported: numerous studies have identified cis-regulatory mutations with functionally significant consequences for morphology, physiology and behaviour. The focus has now shifted to considering whether cis-regulatory and coding mutations make qualitatively different contributions to phenotypic evolution. Cases in which parallel mutations have produced parallel trait modifications in particular suggest that some phenotypic changes are more likely to result from cis-regulatory mutations than from coding mutations.},

abstract = {DNA is generally considered to be confined to the nucleus. Small amounts of DNA sometimes found in other cell fractions are usually attributed to contamination by nuclear material (Allfrey 1959). The presence of significant amounts of extranuclear DNA occurring in the cytoplasm of the amphibian o{\"{o}}cyte (Stich 1962), the kinetosomes (Clark and Wallace 1960), and in the chloroplasts of plant cells (Chun et al. 1963) is well documented but is regarded rather as an exception than as a rule, because in these cases DNA is associated with cellular components absent from higher cells. This paper presents evidence that preparations of mitochondria from baker's yeast, purified by flotation in density gradients, contain a significant quantity of DNA. The amount found is far in excess of that accounted for by the polydeoxyribonucleotide component (Appleby and Morton, 1960) of mitochondrial cytochrome b2. Since the mitochondrion represents an organelle present in most cells, including those of mammals, the occurrence of DNA in yeast mitochondria suggests the possibility, that extranuclear DNA is much more common that hitherto suspected. Mitochondrial function in the yeast cell is in part controlled by extrachromosomal genetic factors (Ephrussi and Hottinguer 1951), whose exact chemical nature is unknown. The presence of DNA in yeast mitochondria is thus of special interest. {\textcopyright} 1964.},

Analysis of the relationship between HBV infection and oncogenesis is difficult because natural infection with HBV is limited to man and experimental infection has been achieved only in chimpanzees and gibbons. Furthermore, because HBV has not been successfully propagated in cell culture, basic study of virus-cell interaction of the aetiological agent of one of the most widespread infections of man has been impossible. Recently, however, a cell line (PLC/PRF/5) derived from a human hepatoma biopsy was described which produces the HRV surface antigen (HBsAg) and so provides a tool for the experimental investigation of HBV in viro. We now report the derivation and characterisation of two additional cell lines primary liver carcinomas. In contrast to the PLC/PRF/5 cell line, these cell lines retain the capacity to synthesise many human plasma proteins, including both albumin and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). One of these lines also produces BHsAg. We also present evidence that HBsAg synthesis and secretion in this cell line are correlated with the growth state of the culture. This finding is in contrast to the continuous HBsAg production found in the PLC/PRF/5 cell line.},

The DNA strand containing 5-aza-CR remained undermethylated in the round of DNA synthesis following analog incorporation. The extent of inhibition of DNA modification and induction of muscle cells in treated cultures were dependent on the 5-aza-CR concentration over a narrow dose range. Experiments with the restriction enzyme Hpa II, which is sensitive to cytosine methylation in the sequence CCGG, demonstrated that the DNA synthesized in 5-aza-CR-treated cultures was maximally undermethylated 48 hr after treatment. Three other analogs of cytidine, containing a modification in the 5 position of the pyrimidine ring [5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine(5-aza-CdR), pseudoisocytidine ($\psi$ICR) and 5-fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine(FCdR)] also induced the formation of muscle cells and inhibited DNA methylation. In contrast, 1-$\beta$-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (araC) and 6-azacytidine (6-aza-CR) did not inhibit DNA methylation or induce muscle formation, whereas 5-6-dihydro-5-azacytidine (dH-aza-CR) was a poor inducer of muscle cells and a poor inhibitor of DNA methylation.

Deletions in the hydrophobic core of H4 are lethal and block chromosomal segregation. In contrast, deletions at the hydrophilic N terminus (residues 4-28) and C terminus (residues 100-102) are viable. However, N-terminal deletion alters normal chromatin structure and lengthens the cell cycle, especially G2. Surprisingly, removal of the H4 N terminus also derepresses the silent mating type loci, HML$\alpha$ and HMRa, disrupting mating. This activation is specific since other regulated genes (GAL10, PHO5, CUP1) are repressed and induced normally in these cells. Deletions of the hydrophilic N termini of H2A or H2B do not show this effect on mating. These experiments allow us to define a unique H4 function that is not shared by other histones (H2A and H2B). {\textcopyright} 1988.},

The proteins encoded by two of these genes, maleless (mle) and male-specific lethal-1 (msl-1), are found associated with the X chromosome in males, suggesting that they act as positive regulators of dosage compensation. A specific acetylated isoform of histone H4, H4Ac16, is also detected predominantly on the male X chromosome. We have found that MLE and MSL-1 bind to the X chromosome in an identical pattern and that the pattern of H4Ac16 on the X is largely coincident with that of MLE/MSL-1. We fail to detect H4Ac16 on the X chromosome in homozygous msl males, correlating with the lack of dosage compensation in these mutants. Conversely, in Sxl mutants, we detect H4Ac16 on the female X chromosomes, coincident with an inappropriate increase in X chromosome transcription. These data suggest that synthesis or localization of H4Ac16 is controlled by the dosage compensation regulatory hierarchy. Dosage compensation may involve H4Ac16 function, potentially through interaction with the product of the msl genes.},

This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

abstract = {Background: Metazoan centromeres are generally composed of large repetitive DNA structures packaged in heterochromatin. Similarly, fission yeast centromeres contain large inverted repeats and two distinct silenced domains that are both required for centromere function. The central domain is flanked by outer repetitive elements coated in histone H3 methylated on lysine 9 and bound by conserved heterochromatin proteins. This centromeric heterochromatin is required for cohesion between sister centromeres. Defective heterochromatin causes premature sister chromatid separation and chromosome missegregation. The role of cis-acting DNA sequences in the formation of centromeric heterochromatin has not been established. Results: A deletion strategy was used to identify centromeric sequences that allow heterochromatin formation in fission yeast. Fragments from the outer repeats are sufficient to cause silencing of an adjacent gene when inserted at a euchromatic chromosomal locus. This silencing is accompanied by the local de novo methylation of histone H3 on lysine 9, recruitment of known heterochromatin components, Swi6 and Chp1, and the provision of a new strong cohesin binding site. In addition, we demonstrate that the chromodomain of Chp1 binds to MeK9-H3 and that Chp1 itself is required for methylation of histone H3 on lysine 9. Conclusions: A short sequence, reiterated at fission yeast centromeres, can direct silent chromatin assembly and cohesin recruitment in a dominant manner. The heterochromatin formed at the euchromatic locus is indistinguishable from that found at endogenous centromeres. Recruitment of Rad21-cohesin underscores the link between heterochromatin and chromatid cohesion and indicates that these centromeric elements act independently of kinetochore activity to recruit cohesin.},

abstract = {DNA methylation and histone modification promote changes in chromatin structure that may affect gene expression in a heritable manner without directly altering the genome. As such, these phenomena are considered to be epigenetic in nature and are believed to contribute to the normal processes of human development but also to aberrant disease states such as cancer. Epigenetic processes probably contribute mechanistically to toxicant-induced changes in gene expression and cancer. Nickel is a potent human carcinogen that has been shown to alter DNA methylation patterns and affect histone acetylation status. Both of these changes are associated with the proximity of the affected regions to heterochromatin. The two processes probably occur in concert in mammalian cells. However, in yeast cells, DNA methylation is absent, and nickel is capable of regulating gene expression through changes in acetylation of the lysine residues in the N terminal tail of histone H4. Arsenic is another important environmental carcinogen, and it is methylated during its metabolism. Hence, it has been proposed that arsenic metabolism may deplete intracellular methyl group stores and thereby lead to changes in DNA methylation that may be involved in carcinogenesis. However, the data concerning DNA methylation changes following arsenic exposure are equivocal, leading researchers to propose that DNA hypo- and hypermethylation are both important in the development of arsenic-induced cancers. Heightened awareness by toxicologists of the importance of epigenetics in normal human development and in carcinogenesis should lead to the identification of other toxicants that manifest their effects, at least in part, via epigenetic mechanisms.},

In this review, we discuss the implications for noncoding RNAs and the formation of specialized chromatin domains in various epigenetic processes as diverse as dosage compensation, RNA interference-mediated heterochromatin assembly and gene silencing, and programmed DNA elimination. While mechanistic details as to how the RNA and chromatin worlds connect remain unclear, intriguing parallels exist in the overall design and machinery used in model organisms from all eukaryotic kingdoms.

Cytosine methylation does not reinforce or replace ancestral gene regulation pathways but instead endows methylated genomes with the ability to repress specific promoters in a manner that is buffered against changes in the internal and external environment. Recent studies have shown that the targeting of de novo methylation depends on multiple inputs; these include the interaction of repeated sequences, local states of histone lysine methylation, small RNAs and components of the RNAi pathway, and divergent and catalytically inert cytosine methyltransferase homologues that have acquired regulatory roles. There are multiple families of DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases in eukaryotes, and each family appears to be controlled by different regulatory inputs. Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, which regulate most aspects of gene expression, do not appear to be involved in the establishment or maintenance of genomic methylation patterns.},

To determine how this epigenetic modification is distributed in the genomes of primary and transformed cells, we used an immunocapturing approach followed by DNA microarray analysis to generate methylation profiles of all human chromosomes at 80-kb resolution and for a large set of CpG islands. In primary cells we identified broad genomic regions of differential methylation with higher levels in gene-rich neighborhoods. Female and male cells had indistinguishable profiles for autosomes but differences on the X chromosome. The inactive X chromosome (Xi) was hypermethylated at only a subset of gene-rich regions and, unexpectedly, overall hypomethylated relative to its active counterpart. The chromosomal methylation profile of transformed cells was similar to that of primary cells. Nevertheless, we detected large genomic segments with hypomethylation in the transformed cell residing in gene-poor areas. Furthermore, analysis of 6,000 CpG islands showed that only a small set of promoters was methylated differentially, suggesting that aberrant methylation of CpG island promoters in malignancy might be less frequent than previously hypothesized.},

abstract = {Empirical studies suggest that the effect sizes of individual causal risk alleles underlying complex genetic diseases are small, with most genotype relative risks in the range of 1.1-2.0. Although the increased risk of disease for a carrier is small for any single locus, knowledge of multiple-risk alleles throughout the genome could allow the identification of individuals that are at high risk. In this study, we investigate the number and effect size of risk loci that underlie complex disease constrained by the disease parameters of prevalence and heritability. Then we quantify the value of prediction of genetic risk to disease using a range of realistic combinations of the number, size, and distribution of risk effects that underlie complex diseases. We propose an approach to assess the genetic risk of a disease in healthy individuals, based on dense genome-wide SNP panels. We test this approach using simulation. When the number of loci contributing to the disease is {\textgreater}50, a large case-control study is needed to identify a set of risk loci for use in predicting the disease risk of healthy people not included in the case-control study. For diseases controlled by 1000 loci of mean relative risk of only 1.04, a case-control study with 10,000 cases and controls can lead to selection of approximately 75 loci that explain {\textgreater}50{\%} of the genetic variance. The 5{\%} of people with the highest predicted risk are three to seven times more likely to suffer the disease than the population average, depending on heritability and disease prevalence.

The number of newborn neurons is dynamically regulated by a variety of factors. Kainic acid-induced seizures, a rodent model of human temporal lobe epilepsy, strongly induce the proliferation of DG neurogenic progenitor cells and are also associated with long-term cognitive impairment. We show here that the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) potently blocked seizure-induced neurogenesis, an effect that appeared to be mainly mediated by inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDAC) and normalizing HDAC-dependent gene expression within the epileptic dentate area. Strikingly, the inhibition of aberrant neurogenesis protected the animals from seizure-induced cognitive impairment in a hippocampus-dependent learning task.Wepropose that seizure-generated granule cells have the potential to interfere with hippocampal function and contribute to cognitive impairment caused by epileptic activity within the hippocampal circuitry. Furthermore, our data indicate that the effectiveness of VPA as an antiepileptic drug may be partially explained by the HDAC-dependent inhibition of aberrant neurogenesis induced by seizure activity within the adult hippocampus.

Such epigenetic control is often associated with alternative covalent modifications of histones.

We developed a simplified stochastic model for dynamic nucleosome modification based on the silent mating-type region of the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We show that the mechanism can give strong bistability that is resistant both to high noise due to random gain or loss of nucleosome modifications and to random partitioning upon DNA replication. However, robust bistability required: (1) cooperativity, the activity of more than one modified nucleosome, in the modification reactions and (2) that nucleosomes occasionally stimulate modification beyond their neighbor nucleosomes, arguing against a simple continuous spreading of nucleosome modification. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The siNMF algorithm simultaneously searches for two factorizations that share the same gene expression profiles. The two key ingredients of this algorithm are the nonnegativity constraint and the offset variables, which together ensure the sparseness of the factorizations. While cancer is a very heterogeneous disease, there is overwhelming recent evidence that the differences between cancer subtypes implicate entire pathways and biological processes involving large numbers of genes, rather than changes in single genes. We have applied our simultaneous factorization algorithm looking for gene expression profiles that are common between the more homogeneous pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and the more heterogeneous colon adenocarcinoma. The fact that the PDAC signature is active in a large fraction of colon adeocarcinoma suggests that the oncogenic mechanisms involved may be similar to those in PDAC, at least in this subset of colon samples. There are many approaches to uncovering common mechanisms involved in different phenotypes, but most are based on comparing gene lists. The approach presented in this paper additionally takes gene expression data into account and can thus be more sensitive.},

abstract = {Computational methods to identify functional genomic elements using genetic information have been very successful in determining gene structure and in identifying a handful of cis-regulatory elements. But the vast majority of regulatory elements have yet to be discovered, and it has become increasingly apparent that their discovery will not come from using genetic information alone. Recently, high-throughput technologies have enabled the creation of information-rich epigenetic maps, most notably for histone modifications. However, tools that search for functional elements using this epigenetic information have been lacking. Here, we describe an unsupervised learning method called ChromaSig to find, in an unbiased fashion, commonly occurring chromatin signatures in both tiling microarray and sequencing data. Applying this algorithm to nine chromatin marks across a 1{\%} sampling of the human genome in HeLa cells, we recover eight clusters of distinct chromatin signatures, five of which correspond to known patterns associated with transcriptional promoters and enhancers. Interestingly, we observe that the distinct chromatin signatures found at enhancers mark distinct functional classes of enhancers in terms of transcription factor and coactivator binding. In addition, we identify three clusters of novel chromatin signatures that contain evolutionarily conserved sequences and potential cis-regulatory elements. Applying ChromaSig to a panel of 21 chromatin marks mapped genomewide by ChIP-Seq reveals 16 classes of genomic elements marked by distinct chromatin signatures. Interestingly, four classes containing enrichment for repressive histone modifications appear to be locally heterochromatic sites and are enriched in quickly evolving regions of the genome. The utility of this approach in uncovering novel, functionally significant genomic elements will aid future efforts of genome annotation via chromatin modifications.},

We estimated the appropriate number metagens by comparing the residual error of NMF reconstruction of data to that of NMF reconstruction of permutated data, thus finding when a given solution contained more information than noise. This analysis also revealed that NMF could not factorize one of the data sets in a meaningful way. We used GO categories and pre defined gene sets to evaluate the biological significance of the obtained metagenes. By analyses of metagenes specific for the same GO-categories we could show that individual metagenes activated different aspects of the same biological processes. Several of the obtained metagenes correlated with tumor subtypes and tumors with characteristic chromosomal translocations, indicating that metagenes may correspond to specific disease entities. Hence, NMF extracts biological relevant structures of microarray expression data and may thus contribute to a deeper understanding of tumor behavior.},

abstract = {Normal mammalian development requires a maternal and paternal contribution, which is attributed to imprinted genes, or genes that are expressed from a single parental allele. Approximately 100 imprinted genes have been reported in mammals thus far. Imprinted genes are controlled by cis-acting regulatory elements, termed imprinting control regions (ICRs), which have parental-specific epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation. ICRs are methylated by de novo DNA methyltransferases during germline development; these parental-specific modifications must be maintained following fertilization when the genome is extensively reprogrammed. Many imprinted genes reside in {\~{}}1-megabase clusters, with two major mechanisms of imprinting regulation currently recognized, CTCF-dependent insulators and long noncoding RNAs. Unclustered imprinted genes are generally regulated by germline-derived differential promoter methylation. Here, we describe the identification and functions of imprinted genes, cis-acting control sequences, trans-acting factors, and imprinting mechanisms in clusters. Finally, we define questions that require more extensive research. {\textcopyright} 2011 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {Chromatin modifications, such as post-translational modification of histone proteins and incorporation of histone variants, play an important role in regulating gene expression. Joint analyses of multiple histone modification maps are starting to reveal combinatorial patterns of modifications that are associated with functional DNA elements, providing support to the 'histone code' hypothesis. However, due to the lack of analytical methods, only a small number of chromatin modification patterns have been discovered so far. Here, we introduce a scalable subspace clustering algorithm, coherent and shifted bicluster identification (CoSBI), to exhaustively identify the set of combinatorial modification patterns across a given epigenome. Performance comparisons demonstrate that CoSBI can generate biclusters with higher intra-cluster coherency and biological relevance. We apply our algorithm to a compendium of 39 genome-wide chromatin modification maps in human CD4(+) T cells. We identify 843 combinatorial patterns that recur at {\textgreater}0.1{\%} of the genome. A total of 19 chromatin modifications are observed in the combinatorial patterns, 10 of which occur in more than half of the patterns. We also identify combinatorial modification signatures for eight classes of functional DNA elements. Application of CoSBI to epigenome maps of different cells and developmental stages will aid in understanding how chromatin structure helps regulate gene expression.},

Most, perhaps all, CGIs are sites of transcription initiation, including thousands that are remote from currently annotated promoters. Shared DNA sequence features adapt CGIs for promoter function by destabilizing nucleosomes and attracting proteins that create a transcriptionally permissive chromatin state. Silencing of CGI promoters is achieved through dense CpG methylation or polycomb recruitment, again using their distinctive DNA sequence composition. CGIs are therefore generically equipped to influence local chromatin structure and simplify regulation of gene activity.},

The emerging picture is that the function of DNA methylation seems to vary with context, and the relationship between DNA methylation and transcription is more nuanced than we realized at first.

Aberrant protein acetylation, particularly on histones, has been related to cancer while abnormal expression of HDACs has been found in a broad range of cancer types. Therefore, HDACs have emerged as promising targets in cancer therapeutics, and the development of HDAC inhibitors (HDIs), a rapidly evolving area of clinical research.

To explore these mechanisms further, we generated catalogs of somatic mutation from 21 breast cancers and applied mathematical methods to extract mutational signatures of the underlying processes. Multiple distinct single- and double-nucleotide substitution signatures were discernible. Cancers with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations exhibited a characteristic combination of substitution mutation signatures and a distinctive profile of deletions. Complex relationships between somatic mutation prevalence and transcription were detected. A remarkable phenomenon of localized hypermutation, termed "kataegis," was observed. Regions of kataegis differed between cancers but usually colocalized with somatic rearrangements. Base substitutions in these regions were almost exclusively of cytosine at TpC dinucleotides. The mechanisms underlying most of these mutational signatures are unknown. However, a role for the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases is proposed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

However, until now there have been no theoretical models describing the signatures of mutational processes operative in cancer genomes and no systematic computational approaches are available to decipher these mutational signatures.

To investigate epigenetic regulation of embryonic development, we differentiated human embryonic stem cells into mesendoderm, neural progenitor cells, trophoblast-like cells, and mesenchymal stem cells and systematically characterized DNA methylation, chromatin modifications, and the transcriptome in each lineage. We found that promoters that are active in early developmental stages tend to be CG rich and mainly engage H3K27me3 upon silencing in nonexpressing lineages. By contrast, promoters for genes expressed preferentially at later stages are often CG poor and primarily employ DNA methylation upon repression. Interestingly, the early developmental regulatory genes are often located in large genomic domains that are generally devoid of DNA methylation in most lineages, which we termed DNA methylation valleys (DMVs). Our results suggest that distinct epigenetic mechanisms regulate early and late stages of ES cell differentiation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

In particular, we suggest that when natural selection acts on pure epigenetic variation in addition to genetic variation, populations adapt faster, and adaptive phenotypes can arise before any genetic changes. This may make it difficult to reconcile the timing of adaptive events detected using conventional population genetics tools based on DNA sequence data with environmental drivers of adaptation, such as changes in climate. Epigenetic modifications are frequently associated with somatic cell differentiation, but recently epigenetic changes have been found that can be transmitted over many generations. Here, we show how the interplay of these heritable epigenetic changes with genetic changes can affect adaptive evolution, and how epigenetic changes affect the signature of selection in the genetic record.},

With the recent availability of large genome-wide data sets, often comprising several epigenetic marks, novel approaches are required to explore functionally relevant interactions between histone modifications. Computational discovery of "chromatin states" defined by such combinatorial interactions enabled descriptive annotations of genomes, but more quantitative approaches are needed to progress towards predictive models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We propose non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) as a new unsupervised method to discover combinatorial patterns of epigenetic marks that frequently co-occur in subsets of genomic regions. We show that this small set of combinatorial "codes" can be effectively displayed and interpreted. NMF codes enable dimensionality reduction and have desirable statistical properties for regression and classification tasks. We demonstrate the utility of codes in the quantitative prediction of Pol2-binding and the discrimination between Pol2-bound promoters and enhancers. Finally, we show that specific codes can be linked to molecular pathways and targets of pluripotency genes during differentiation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We have introduced and evaluated a new computational approach to represent combinatorial patterns of epigenetic marks as quantitative variables suitable for predictive modeling and supervised machine learning.

abstract = {Meningioma is the most common primary brain tumor and carries a substantial risk of local recurrence. Methylation profiles of meningioma and their clinical implications are not well understood. We hypothesized that aggressive meningiomas have unique DNA methylation patterns that could be used to better stratify patient management. Samples (n = 140) were profiled using the Illumina HumanMethylation450BeadChip. Unsupervised modeling on a training set (n = 89) identified 2 molecular methylation subgroups of meningioma (MM) with significantly different recurrence-free survival (RFS) times between the groups: a prognostically unfavorable subgroup (MM-UNFAV) and a prognostically favorable subgroup (MM-FAV). This finding was validated in the remaining 51 samples and led to a baseline meningioma methylation classifier (bMMC) defined by 283 CpG loci (283-bMMC). To further optimize a recurrence predictor, probes subsumed within the baseline classifier were subject to additional modeling using a similar training/validation approach, leading to a 64-CpG loci meningioma methylation predictor (64-MMP). After adjustment for relevant clinical variables [WHO grade, mitotic index, Simpson grade, sex, location, and copy number aberrations (CNAs)] multivariable analyses for RFS showed that the baseline methylation classifier was not significant (p = 0.0793). The methylation predictor, however, was significantly associated with tumor recurrence (p {\textless} 0.0001). CNAs were extracted from the 450k intensity profiles. Tumor samples in the MM-UNFAV subgroup showed an overall higher proportion of CNAs compared to the MM-FAV subgroup tumors and the CNAs were complex in nature. CNAs in the MM-UNFAV subgroup included recurrent losses of 1p, 6q, 14q and 18q, and gain of 1q, all of which were previously identified as indicators of poor outcome. In conclusion, our analyses demonstrate robust DNA methylation signatures in meningioma that correlate with CNAs and stratify patients by recurrence risk.},

Here, we propose a novel approach to explore functional interactions between different epigenetic modifications and extract combinatorial profiles that can be used to annotate the chromatin in a finite number of functional classes. Our method is based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), an unsupervised learning technique originally employed to decompose high-dimensional data in a reduced number of meaningful patterns. We applied the NMF algorithm to a set of different epigenetic marks, consisting of ChIP-seq assays for multiple histone modifications, Pol II binding and chromatin accessibility assays from human H1 cells.
 We identified a number of chromatin profiles that contain functional information and are biologically interpretable. We also observe that epigenetic profiles are characterized by specific genomic contexts and show significant association with distinct genomic features. Moreover, analysis of RNA-seq data reveals that distinct chromatin signatures correlate with the level of gene expression. Overall, our study highlights the utility of NMF in studying functional relationships between different epigenetic modifications and may provide new biological insights for the interpretation of the chromatin dynamics.},
