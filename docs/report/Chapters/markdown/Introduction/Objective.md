Over the present analysis, aspects of these previous analysis have been reproduced, adopting the processing of the data scheme \cite{Gandolfi2017}, segmenting the genome into 200-bp bins and extending the analysis to three cancer cell types for which eleven common epigenetic marks were available. Results show that there are similar chromatin signatures found for these tissues, suggesting a possible generalization of the chromatin profiles in normal and cancer cells.
