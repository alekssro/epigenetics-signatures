# Epigenetics

The genetic material is known to be modified during the life of an organism, possibly causing modifications in gene behavior. Far is known about mutations being a mayor player in genetic variation and the profiling of these variations has proved to be highly useful when studying diseases and evolutionary theory [GWAS]. In eukaryotes, there are in addition mechanisms in which the DNA can be modified without altering the molecular sequence, so called epigenetic mechanisms. As Conrad Waddington, who coined the term "epigenetics", defined: "it is the branch of biology which studies the causal interactions between genes and their products, which bring the phenotype into being" [Waddington]. Such definition led to categorizing as epigenetics all biological phenomena which correlated the genetic material with the genetic products and were not explained entirely by the classic genetic studies. Further studies have revealed that epigenetic mechanisms can be modulated in response to external stimuli [CITATION], entailing an overlay between DNA  and environment for the cells and organisms. Moreover, the epigenetic mechanisms behavior can vary for different stages of cell development [CITATION], environmental changes [CITATION] or disease [CITATIONS]. In the same way genetic variability can be profiled, it is possible to decipher shared patterns for the epigenetic modifications in different scenarios and types of tissue. Due to the latest growth on research efforts and resources about the topic, we were able to characterized the inheritance of gene expression patterns not explained by the encoded information in the DNA sequence but through epigenetic modifications. High-throughput technologies such as Chromatin Inmunoprecipitation next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) or Whole-Genome Bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), allowed us to obtain an incredibly vast amount of information on epigenetic marks throughout the genome. It was then possible to determine the epigenome profile with several chromatin states that enhance or repress the gene activity in a local and cell-specific manner. These ``epigenomic profiling'' helped the understanding of cell differentiation, where even though the vast majority of cells in a multicellular organism share an identical genotype, organismal development generates a diversity of cell types with disparate, yet stable, profiles of gene expression and distinct cellular functions. More specifically, epigenetics may be defined as “the study of any potentially stable and, ideally, heritable change in gene expression or cellular phenotype that occurs without changes in Watson-Crick base-pairing of DNA” [CITATION Gol07].

Conrad Waddington, who coined the term “epigenetics” defined it as “the branch of biology which studies the causal interactions between genes and their products, which bring the phenotype into being” [CITATION Wad11 \l 3082 ], which led to categorizing as epigenetics all kind of biological phenomena that were considered as inexplicable by the classic genetics studies. Thanks to the recent explosion of research efforts, resources and literature about the topic, we now know there is an inheritance of gene expression patterns, without altering the DNA sequence, explained by the epigenetic mechanisms. The technological advances, such as the Chromatin Inmunoprecipitation next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq), allowed us to determine the epigenome profile with several chromatin states that enhance or repress the gene activity in a local and cell-specific manner. These ‘epigenomic profiling’ helped the understanding of cell differentiation, where even though the vast majority of cells in a multicellular organism share an identical genotype, organismal development generates a diversity of cell types with disparate, yet stable, profiles of gene expression and distinct cellular functions. More specifically, epigenetics may be defined as “the study of any potentially stable and, ideally, heritable change in gene expression or cellular phenotype that occurs without changes in Watson-Crick base-pairing of DNA” [ CITATION Gol07 \l 3082 ].
The pioneer work put through the years 1869-1928 by Miescher, Flemming, Kossel and Heitz defined nucleic acids, chromatin and histone proteins, which led to the cytological distinction between euchromatin and heterochromatin[ CITATION Hei28 \l 3082 ]. This discovery entailed the dawn to give an explanation of the tissue-differentiated expression and it was followed by translocations studies carried out in Drosophila melanogaster [ CITATION Mul30 \l 3082 ], and chromosome organization and genic expression in maize [ CITATION McC51 \l 3082 ], which provided early hints of non-Mendelian inheritance. The discovery of X-chromosome inactivation in female mammals [CITATION Lyo61 \l 3082 ] and imprinting genes [ CITATION Sur84 \l 3082  \m McG84] instated the concept of turning ‘on’ and ‘off’ regions of the genetic material. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms were mostly unknown and were discovered more recently.
